## Application: "Logistics Company"

### Task
Implement a web application, "Logistics Company," designed to manage processes within a logistics company. The primary activity of the company is to provide acceptance and delivery services for parcels. The company has offices in various locations and employs two types of staff: couriers (responsible for parcel delivery) and office workers (serve clients at the company's offices). The company's clients send and/or receive parcels from the company's offices or from another address. Parcels have a sender, receiver, delivery address, and weight. The price for delivery is determined by the weight of the parcel and whether it will be delivered to an office or a specific address. Deliveries to offices are cheaper than those to specific addresses. Company staff can view all parcels registered in the system. Each client can only see the parcels they have sent, received, or are expecting to receive.

### Functional Requirements of the System
The web application "Logistics Company" should include at least the following functionalities:
1. User registration and login to the system.
2. Ability to assign roles to users (staff, client).
3. Input, display, edit, and deletion of data for:
    a. Logistics Company
    b. Company staff
    c. Company clients
    d. Company offices
    e. Parcels
4. Company staff should be able to register sent and received parcels.
5. Reports for:
    a. All company staff
    b. All company clients
    c. All registered parcels
    d. Parcels registered by a specific staff member
    e. Parcels sent but not received
    f. Parcels sent by a specific client
    g. Parcels received by a specific client
    h. All company revenues for a specific period
6. Each staff member can view all parcels.
7. Each client can view the parcels they have sent or received.

### Technological Requirements
The application should be web-based and compatible with major browsers (Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, Internet Explorer). Its design should be responsive (suitable for visualization on mobile devices).

The developed system should consist of code, a database, and documentation. The code should include detailed comments. The documentation should comprise a detailed description of the system's functionalities, including screens that clearly illustrate the purpose of each part of the program.
